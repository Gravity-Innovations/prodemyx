1. Your EC2 user is correct
EC2_USER = ubuntu


This matches the official Ubuntu AMI and is valid.

No changes needed.

2. Your EC2 host is correct
EC2_HOST = ec2-16-171-24-103.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com


This is a valid public DNS.
Your GitHub Actions runner can reach it if the EC2 security group allows SSH from 0.0.0.0/0 or GitHub IP ranges.

No changes needed here either.

3. Your deployment directories are correct and valid

Your values:

EC2_BACKEND_PATH     = /var/www/prodemyx-backend
EC2_FRONTEND_PATH    = /var/www/prodemyx-frontend
EC2_PRODEMYX_PATH    = /var/www/prodemyx-website

All three are valid Unix absolute paths.
Permissions can be set using chown/chmod.

fix these errors
do not change project folders instead try to fix by changing the yml files only
